# TCC
Software part of my undergraduate thesis in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Technology – Parana (UTFPR), Brazil.

This work uses meta-planning, which is part of the research presented in these papers:
- "Learning STRIPS action models with classical planning" ([ICAPS 2018](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13870))
- "Learning action models with minimal observability" ([AIJ 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370218304259))
- "Model recognition as planning" ([ICAPS 2019](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/3547))
